Description:

    Open AT Parser is a simple C language project that can be used in several applications, like remote
controlled devices, modems and microcontrolled devices. 
    The program has a minimalistic task scheduler, that runs two tasks, one to get data from IO and other
to parse and execute pre defined commands. Current IO tasks implementation is using shell console , but it
can be easily adapted to use serial ports for instance.

How to compile:

    This project compiles using gcc. I'm current using XCode 4.1 but I intend to create a cross-platform makefile.

    1) Open OpenATParser.xcodeproj
    2) Explore the source starting by main.c (optional)
    3) Hit Run button.
